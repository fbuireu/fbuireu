### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm a front end developer based in Barcelona 

-----

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: got 99 projects but finishing them ain't one. (For real though, I love starting stuff from scratch and fresh ideas).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Learning cool stuff as always, right now I'm obsessed with **Gatsby**, **React** and **JavaScript**. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: open-source projects, the core of any amazing frameworks, world domination/overthrowing capitalism. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: that time I invented a new risotto recipe during quarantine, or anything Gatsby-related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [![CodePen][1]][2]
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love a challenge. That's why I run half-marathons and still haven't given up on flipping tortillas. I know I can do it. My girlfriend disagrees.
